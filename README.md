Hello Humans!

I am excited to acquire more programming skills specifically in python, java and web-development. I know it will be quite an interesting journey and also a rewarding one. 

Don't wait till you are fully prepared! Can you ever be fully prepared for anything? Life is full of surprises, start the journey and embrace the challenges along the way. They only make you stronger and more experienced!

Cheers to stronger skillsets!
